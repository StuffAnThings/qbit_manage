
# Overview

The script utilizes a YAML config file to load information to connect to the various APIs you can connect with. Alternatively, you can configure qBit Manage using the [Web UI](Web-UI), which requires the [Web API](Web-API) to be enabled.

## Default Configuration File Locations

The script looks for the configuration file in different locations depending on your platform:

### Local Installation (Platform-specific)
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\qbit-manage\config.yml` (typically `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\qbit-manage\config.yml`)
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/qbit-manage/config.yml`
- **Linux/Unix**: `~/.config/qbit-manage/config.yml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/qbit-manage/config.yml` if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set)

### Docker Installation
- `/app/config.yml` (inside the container)

You can override the default location by using the `--config-file` or `-c` command line option to specify a custom path.

A template Configuration File can be found in the repo [config/config.yml.sample](https://github.com/StuffAnThings/qbit_manage/blob/master/config/config.yml.sample).

You can reference environment variables inside your `config.yml` by `!ENV VAR_NAME`

## **cat:**

---
This section defines the categories that you are currently using and the save path's that are associated with them.

The `cat` command will use the cats defined to Category function takes the save path of the torrent and assigns the category to it based on that save path

> [!WARNING]
> **ALL save paths** of all torrents must be defined here. If the save path is in your qBit, then it **MUST** be defined here, if not the script will throw errors.
> If you want to leave a save_path as uncategorized you can use the key 'Uncategorized' as the name of the category.
> You may map a folder and its subdirectories to a single folder by appending `*` to the path e.g. `<path>/<to>/category/*`

| Configuration | Definition                | Required           |

## **cat_change:**

---

If you are unsure what key word to use. Simply select a torrent within qB and down at the bottom you should see a tab that says `Trackers` within the list that is populated there are ea list of trackers that are associated with this torrent, select a keyword from there and add it to the config file. Make sure this key word is unique enough that the script will not get confused with any other tracker.

>[!TIP]
> The `other` key is a special keyword and if defined will tag any other trackers that don't match the above trackers into this tag.

> [!NOTE]
> If `other` is not used then trackers will be auto added.

## **nohardlinks:**

---
Hardlinking data allows you to have your data in both the torrent directory and your media directory at the same time without using double the amount of data.

If you're needing information regarding hardlinks here are some excellent resources.

## **share_limits:**

Control how torrent share limits are set depending on the priority of your grouping. This can apply a max ratio, seed time limits to your torrents or limit your torrent upload speed as well. Each torrent will be matched with the share limit group with the highest priority that meets the group filter criteria. Each torrent can only be matched with one share limit group.

## **recyclebin:**

---
  Recycle Bin method of deletion will move files into the recycle bin (Located in /root_dir/.RecycleBin) instead of directly deleting them in qbit.

  This is very useful if you're hesitant about using this script to delete information off your system hingswithout first checking it. Plus with the ability of this script to remove trumped/unregistered torrents there is a very small chance that something may happen to cause the script to go to town on  your library. With the recycling bin in place your data is secure (unless the bin is emptied before this issue is caught). All you'd need to do to recover would be to place the data back into the correct directory, redownload the torrent file from the tracker and recheck the torrent with the tracker from the UI.

This section allows for the exclusion of certain files from being considered "Orphaned"

This is handy when you have automatically generated files that certain OSs decide to make. `.DS_Store` Is a primary example, for those who use MacOS.
