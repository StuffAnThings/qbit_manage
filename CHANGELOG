# Breaking Change
- `requirements.txt` is now replaced with `pyproject.toml` meaning that **local installs** will need to replace their update command `pip install -r requirements.txt` with `pip install .`
- Those that are running qbit-manage in docker don't need to do anything and things will continue to work as is
